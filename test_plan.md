Testing binary tree:
 - Basic testing practices (make sure functions conform to their descriptions, null pointer tests, valgrind, etc)
 - For change scenarios, serialize the result and compare against the expected result
 - Test different shapes (fully unbalanced, fully balanced, half and half, different depths)
